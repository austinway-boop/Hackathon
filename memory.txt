HACKATHON PROJECT FIXES - RUN.PY

Fixed Issue: Run.py was failing due to missing Flask installation
Solution Applied:
1. Activated CORRECT virtual environment (source .venv/bin/activate)
2. Installed Flask==2.3.3 directly in .venv environment 
3. Successfully started Flask server on http://localhost:5000

Status: âœ… Run.py is now working properly
Server accessible at: http://localhost:5000
Dependencies: Flask and all required packages now installed in .venv

Important: Must use .venv/bin/activate (not bin/activate)
Date: Current session
